# MT-paper-lists
This paper list maintained by the NiuTrans team contains machine translation papers from recent conferences including ACL, EMNLP, NAACL and COLING. Meanwhile, we collect some interesting research works grouped by different areas, such as deep network, neural architecture search and so on. Please contact Yinqiao Li (li.yin.qiao.2012@hotmail.com) or Bei Li (libei_neu@outlook.com) if there are any questions or comments.
